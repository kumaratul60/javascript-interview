        A promise is an object that represents eventual completion or failure of

         It work based on fail-fast method. if all promises are
        fulfilled: It wait for all of them to finish and then return an array of
        promises result. if any of them rejected then Promise.all immediate
        throw an error as a response. it'lln't wait for other promises.

      <li>
         if all promises are fulfilled: It wait for all of
        them to finish or setteled and then return an array of promises result.
        if any of them rejected then Promise.allSetteled return an array of
        fullfiled promises result and reject promise result as error message.
        basically it won't be return an error for rejecting the promise case.

      <li>
         Promise.race means the person who'll finish first is the
        winner. it'll return the result of the first promise that settles,
        either fulfilled or rejected.
      </li>

         It is kind of success seeking race. It'll wait for the
        first promise to resolve/fullfiled/success and return the promise result
        as a response. If all of them promises get failed or rejected then
        return result will be an aggrigated error, this aggrigateError will be
        an array of all the promises error, i.e [err1,err2,err3,...] It returns
        the result of the first promise that settles successfully. If no promise
        settles successfully and one rejects, it will throw an error.
